# Fee Management System Requirements

## Introduction

The Fee Management system is a critical component of the EduShield SIS that handles student fee information, payment tracking, and financial record management. This system will enable administrators to manage various types of fees (tuition, lab fees, library fees, etc.), track payment statuses, generate payment records, and provide students with visibility into their financial obligations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create and manage different types of fees for students, so that I can track all financial obligations within the institution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a new fee THEN the system SHALL store the fee with type, amount, due date, and student association
2. WHEN an administrator specifies a fee type THEN the system SHALL accept predefined types (Tuition, Lab Fee, Library Fee, Activity Fee, Other)
3. WHEN a fee amount is entered THEN the system SHALL validate it is a positive decimal value with up to 2 decimal places
4. WHEN a due date is set THEN the system SHALL ensure it is not in the past
5. IF a student ID is provided THEN the system SHALL verify the student exists before creating the fee

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view and update existing fee records, so that I can maintain accurate financial information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator requests fee information THEN the system SHALL return all fee details including payment status
2. WHEN an administrator updates a fee amount THEN the system SHALL validate the new amount and update the record
3. WHEN an administrator updates a due date THEN the system SHALL ensure the new date is valid
4. WHEN a fee is marked as paid THEN the system SHALL prevent further modifications to the fee amount
5. WHEN viewing fees THEN the system SHALL display calculated status (Paid, Overdue, Pending)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to record payments against student fees, so that I can track payment history and outstanding balances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment is recorded THEN the system SHALL associate it with a specific fee and student
2. WHEN a payment amount is entered THEN the system SHALL validate it does not exceed the outstanding fee amount
3. WHEN a payment is processed THEN the system SHALL update the fee status to reflect the payment
4. WHEN a full payment is made THEN the system SHALL mark the fee as "Paid"
5. WHEN a partial payment is made THEN the system SHALL calculate and store the remaining balance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to retrieve fee information by student or fee type, so that I can generate reports and track financial data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching by student ID THEN the system SHALL return all fees associated with that student
2. WHEN filtering by fee type THEN the system SHALL return all fees of the specified type
3. WHEN filtering by payment status THEN the system SHALL return fees matching the status criteria
4. WHEN requesting overdue fees THEN the system SHALL return fees past their due date with unpaid balances
5. WHEN generating fee summaries THEN the system SHALL calculate total amounts, paid amounts, and outstanding balances

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view my fee obligations and payment history, so that I can understand my financial status with the institution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student requests their fees THEN the system SHALL return only fees associated with their student ID
2. WHEN displaying fee information THEN the system SHALL show fee type, amount, due date, and payment status
3. WHEN showing payment history THEN the system SHALL display payment dates, amounts, and remaining balances
4. WHEN calculating totals THEN the system SHALL provide summary of total fees, total paid, and total outstanding
5. WHEN fees are overdue THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate overdue status and amounts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation and error handling for fee operations, so that data integrity is maintained and users receive clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error messages
2. WHEN a non-existent student ID is referenced THEN the system SHALL return a "Student not found" error
3. WHEN a non-existent fee ID is accessed THEN the system SHALL return a "Fee not found" error
4. WHEN payment exceeds outstanding balance THEN the system SHALL return a "Payment exceeds outstanding amount" error
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes
