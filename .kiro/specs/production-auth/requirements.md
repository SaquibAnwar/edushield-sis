# Production Authentication & Authorization System Requirements

## Introduction

The Production Authentication & Authorization system will replace the current development-only authentication with a secure, production-ready solution. This system will implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration with Google/Microsoft identity providers, role-based access control, and secure user management. The system must ensure that only authenticated users can access the application, with proper authorization controls based on user roles (SchoolAdmin, Teacher, Student, Parent).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to integrate with external identity providers (Google/Microsoft) using OpenID Connect, so that users can authenticate securely without managing passwords locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access the application THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the configured OIDC provider for authentication
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with the OIDC provider THEN the system SHALL receive and validate the JWT token
3. WHEN the JWT token is validated THEN the system SHALL extract user claims (email, name, sub) and create a local user session
4. WHEN the OIDC provider returns an error THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and deny access
5. IF the JWT token is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the request and require re-authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to implement role-based access control with multiple user roles, so that different types of users have appropriate permissions within the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL assign them one of the predefined roles (SchoolAdmin, Teacher, Student, Parent)
2. WHEN a SchoolAdmin accesses any endpoint THEN the system SHALL allow full access to all resources
3. WHEN a Teacher accesses student/performance data THEN the system SHALL allow access only to students in their classes
4. WHEN a Student accesses their data THEN the system SHALL allow access only to their own records
5. WHEN a Parent accesses student data THEN the system SHALL allow access only to their child's records

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user accounts and role assignments, so that I can control who has access to the system and what they can do.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user authenticates for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a local user record with default permissions
2. WHEN an administrator assigns a role to a user THEN the system SHALL update the user's permissions immediately
3. WHEN a user's role is changed THEN the system SHALL invalidate their current session and require re-authentication
4. WHEN a user is deactivated THEN the system SHALL deny all access attempts for that user
5. WHEN viewing user management THEN the system SHALL display all users with their roles and last login information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure token handling and session management, so that user sessions are protected against common security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing JWT tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure, HTTP-only cookies with appropriate security flags
2. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to the login page
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all session tokens and clear authentication cookies
4. WHEN detecting suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL log security events and optionally lock the user account
5. WHEN handling token refresh THEN the system SHALL validate the refresh token and issue new access tokens securely

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive audit logging for authentication and authorization events, so that I can monitor system security and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, user ID, and IP address
2. WHEN a user fails to authenticate THEN the system SHALL log the failed attempt with details
3. WHEN a user accesses protected resources THEN the system SHALL log the access attempt and authorization result
4. WHEN administrative actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log the action, performer, and affected resources
5. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL log detailed information and trigger alerts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to work seamlessly with the existing application architecture, so that minimal changes are required to existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing controllers THEN the system SHALL work with current [Authorize] attributes
2. WHEN accessing user context THEN the system SHALL provide user information through standard ASP.NET Core claims
3. WHEN the system is in development mode THEN the system SHALL optionally bypass authentication for testing
4. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL enforce authentication on all protected endpoints
5. WHEN existing tests run THEN the system SHALL not break current test functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration options for different environments, so that I can easily deploy the system across development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring OIDC providers THEN the system SHALL support multiple providers (Google, Microsoft, custom)
2. WHEN setting up environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configuration files
3. WHEN changing authentication settings THEN the system SHALL not require code changes, only configuration updates
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL validate all required configuration values are present
5. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL use appropriate security settings for each environment
